## About CBT and ABCD Model

The ABCD model (Activating event-Beliefs-Consequences-Dispute) allows you to analyze situations, identify cognitive distortions in your beliefs, find more rational alternatives, and reduce the intensity of negative emotions.

- Step-by-step creation of notes using the ABCD model
- Structured storage and management of notes
- Library of cognitive distortions with descriptions and examples
